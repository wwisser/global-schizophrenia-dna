# Global-Schizophrenia

**Global-Schizophrenia** is an interdisciplinary initiative exploring how global systems mirror the fragmentation of thought and perception seen in schizophrenia. By combining principles from neuroscience, sociology, and cutting-edge artificial intelligence, this project seeks to decode, simulate, and mitigate the fractured narratives that drive modern social and political polarization.

---

## Project Description

The project draws a conceptual analogy between the symptoms of schizophrenia—such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thought—and global phenomena like:
- **Misinformation and Conspiracy Theories:** Analogous to delusional beliefs.
- **Echo Chambers and Polarization:** Comparable to cognitive fragmentation.
- **Algorithmic Amplification:** Echoing disordered feedback loops in the brain.

By leveraging AGI, network analysis, and a deep understanding of human psychology, **Global-Schizophrenia** aims to provide:
- **Analysis Tools:** Detect and map disinformation flows, polarization trends, and emerging "narrative fractures."
- **Simulation Models:** Recreate fragmented narratives for analysis and intervention design.
- **Actionable Insights:** Help policymakers, technologists, and communities promote coherent, inclusive global conversations.

## DNA Code in Zig: A Digital Metaphor for Global Narrative Assembly

To further the concept of coherence and fragmentation, we include DNA-inspired code written in **Zig**. DNA serves as a metaphor for narratives: sequences that must be assembled correctly to produce functional "organisms" of thought. The following code models DNA sequence assembly and mutation detection:

```zig
const std = @import("std");

// A module to simulate DNA sequence assembly and mutation analysis
pub fn main() !void {
    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();

    // Define a DNA base type
    const DNA = enum {
        A, C, G, T
    };

    // Example DNA strand sequence
    const dnaSequence = [_]DNA{ DNA.A, DNA.T, DNA.G, DNA.C, DNA.T, DNA.A };

    try stdout.print("Original DNA Sequence: {}\n", .{dnaToString(dnaSequence)});

    // Mutate the DNA sequence
    var mutatedSequence = dnaSequence;
    mutatedSequence[3] = DNA.G; // Introduce a mutation
    try stdout.print("Mutated DNA Sequence: {}\n", .{dnaToString(mutatedSequence)});

    // Compare the sequences
    const diff = detectMutation(dnaSequence, mutatedSequence);
    if (diff) |idx| {
        try stdout.print("Mutation detected at position {}\n", .{idx});
    } else {
        try stdout.print("No mutations detected.\n", .{});
    }
}

// Helper to convert DNA enum array to string representation
fn dnaToString(sequence: []const DNA) []const u8 {
    var buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;
    var cursor = 0;

    for (sequence) |base| {
        const char = switch (base) {
            DNA.A => 'A',
            DNA.C => 'C',
            DNA.G => 'G',
            DNA.T => 'T',
        };
        buffer[cursor] = char;
        cursor += 1;
    }
    return buffer[0..cursor];
}

// Detect mutation by comparing two sequences
fn detectMutation(original: []const DNA, mutated: []const DNA) ?usize {
    if (original.len != mutated.len) return null;

    for (original) |base, idx| {
        if (base != mutated[idx]) return idx;
    }
    return null;
}
